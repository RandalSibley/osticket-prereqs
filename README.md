<h1>osTicket - Prerequisites and Installation</h1>
This tutorial outlines the prerequisites and installation of the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.  In this video, I will be installing osTicket onto a virtual machine created in Azure. I will first begin by creating my resources in Azure, which include a resource group, and a virtual machine. I will then log into the VM using remote desktop and begin installation of all pre-requisite software. I will then install osTicket software and begin setting up the Helpdesk. Lastly, I will install HeidiSQL to complete installation of osTicket.  In the second video, I will be cleaning up all of my resource groups by deleting all resources from the Azure portal before logging out of the system.
